# 💻 Evaristo R. Rivieccio Vega

## 👨‍💻 About Me

Sysadmin with experience in L1 and L2 support, service monitoring, cloud infrastructure operations and maintenance, managing GNU-Linux and Windows servers, and automating tasks using Shell Scripting and Python.  

From 2010 to 2019, I worked in the audiovisual sector, specifically in the field of digital post-production, VFX, and 3D. Over these years, I discovered that my greatest passion lies in tackling technological challenges. This realization led me to redirect my professional career towards System Administration, where I currently enjoy every challenge with the same enthusiasm as the first day.
